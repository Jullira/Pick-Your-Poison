## What you need to run it:
A postgre database structure with
- User: pyp
- password: asdf1234

A web-browser
We recommend Chrome


A intellij IDE
To run the program as it has not been compiled yet.

## How to run it:

When the program is running in intellij you will need to go to this page: http://localhost:8080/
Then you can access the search site by clicking the Drink button.

Note that the db is empty as is, you might want to use the text in pypData.txt at the database command line to populate the database. You can do that after the first time you run the program.
To see the search function write Bobo into the search field and press "I HAVE PICKED MY POISON!" button after the data has been inserted into the database.
